Once upon a time
There was a group of four aristocrats, who were in danger.
They've been in hiding for three days now, and only have food for another two. 
They worried so much about how to survive. 
When suddenly a giant turtle attacked!
They remembered they had a skilled tutrlte slayer in their group, and she fought off the turtle alone.
