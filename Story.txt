Once upon a time
There was a group of four aristocrats, who were in danger.
They've been in hiding for three days now, and only have food for another two. 
They worried so much about how to survive. 
When suddenly a giant turtle attacked!
They remembered they had a skilled turtle slayer in their group, and she fought off the turtle alone.
After her victory, they all went to hug her. But she realized she had been stabbed.
Then she started bleeding a lot.
